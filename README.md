# Pyber

This project converts hypothetical rider and driver ridesharing data stored in csv format into useful and insightful graphs using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy.  Below is a list of each file and its purpose.

pyber_starter_final - Code to read the data, compile it and output into 4 charts using the libraries listed above.

Pie_Drivers, Pie_Fares, Pie_Rides - Pie charts summarizing data for drivers, fares and rides.

Bubble Homework - A bubble chart displaying average fares and number of rides by departure city.  Each bubble is sized by number of drivers per city.  Bubbles are colored by type of city.
